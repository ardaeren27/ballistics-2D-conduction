# Use the function call from "Main" script instead of running each section separately #
The first main triggers the single-shot FV solver
The main_repeated_rifling triggers the FV solver for multiple shooting processes
ballistics solver can be triggered directly, but FV codes also initiate it to construct boundary conditions as well
